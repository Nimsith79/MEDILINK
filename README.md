tele-doc-flow â€” PHP MVC conversion scaffold
==========================================

What I produced:
- Extracted the 'public/' static assets from the original project into the new project.
- Created a minimal PHP MVC scaffold:
  - public/index.php (front controller)
  - app/controllers/HomeController.php
  - app/views/home/index.php (contains the original index.html as a starting point)
  - config/app.php
  - app/helpers/functions.php
  - .htaccess for simple routing

Important notes & next steps (manual work required):
- The original project is a React + TypeScript + Tailwind project (source files in /src).
  Converting all React components, TSX, and Tailwind styles into pure PHP/HTML/CSS/JS
  is non-trivial and must be done file-by-file.
- I did NOT automatically convert React components to PHP/HTML. The view file 'app/views/home/index.php'
  contains the original index.html where the root <div id="root"></div> has been replaced with
  a placeholder. You should manually translate each React component (src/components/**, src/pages/**)
  into PHP partials under app/views/ (e.g. app/views/partials/) and include them.
- Tailwind CSS classes used inside React components must be converted into standard CSS rules
  or a compiled CSS file. You can either:
  1) Extract the final built CSS from the original project's build (if available), or
  2) Recreate equivalent CSS manually (recommended for full removal of Tailwind).
- Any dynamic behavior (React state, client-side interactivity) must be ported to vanilla JS.
- If the original app used APIs or server endpoints, create matching PHP controllers and models.

Files left in the original ZIP that need conversion:
- src/  (React + TypeScript source; ~66 files)

How I can continue (choose one):
- I can convert the app screen-by-screen (recommended): you'll get each page converted to PHP/HTML/CSS/JS.
- I can prioritize converting components used in the main routes first (home/dashboard/auth).
- Or I can convert everything automatically, but accuracy will be lower and manual fixes will be needed.
